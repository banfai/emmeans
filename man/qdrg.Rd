\usage{
qdrg(formula, data, coef, vcov, df, mcmc, object, subset, weights, contrasts,
  link, qr, ordinal, ...)

\method{qdrg}{default}(object, formula = stats::formula(object),
  data = try(recover_data.lm(object), silent = TRUE),
  coef = stats::coef(object), vcov = stats::vcov(object),
  df = stats::df.residual(object), mcmc, subset,
  weights = stats::weights(object), contrasts = object$contrasts,
  link = object$family$link, qr = object$qr, ordinal, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula for the fixed effects}

\item{data}{Dataset containing the variables in the model}

\item{coef}{Fixed-effect regression coefficients (must conform to formula)}

\item{vcov}{Variance-covariance matrix of the fixed effects}

\item{df}{Error degrees of freedom}

\item{mcmc}{Posterior sample of fixed-effect coefficients}

\item{object}{Optional model object. \emph{This rarely works!}; 
but if provided, we try to set 
other arguments based on an expectation that `object` has a similar
structure to `lm` objects. See Details.}

\item{subset}{Subset of \code{data} used in fitting the model}

\item{weights}{Weights used in fitting the model}

\item{contrasts}{List of contrasts specified in fitting the model}

\item{link}{Link function (character or list) used, if a generalized linear model.
(Note: response transformations are auto-detected from \code{formula})}

\item{qr}{QR decomposition of the model matrix; used only if there are \code{NA}s
in \code{coef}.}

\item{ordinal}{\code{list} with elements \code{dim} and \code{mode}.
\code{ordinal$dim} (integer) is the number of levels in an ordinal response. If 
\code{ordinal} is provided, the intercept terms are modified appropriate to predicting 
an ordinal response, as described in \code{vignette("models")}, Section O,
using \code{ordinal$mode} as the \code{mode} argument (if not
provided, \code{"latent"} is assumed).
(All modes are supported except `scale`)
For this to work, we expect
the first \code{ordinal$dim - 1} elements of \code{coef} to be the
estimated threshold parameters, followed by the coefficients for the
linear predictor.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments passed to \code{\link{ref_grid}}}
}
\value{
An \code{emmGrid} object constructed from the arguments
}
\description{
This function may make it possible to compute a reference grid for a model 
object that is otherwise not supported.
}
\details{
Usually, you need to provide either \code{object}; or
\code{formula}, \code{coef}, \code{vcov}, \code{data}, and perhaps other
parameters. It is often fairly straightforward to figure out how to get
these from the model \code{object}; see the documentation for the model class that
was fitted. Sometimes one or more of these quantities contains extra parameters,
and if so, you may need to subset them to make everything conformable. For a given \code{formula} and \code{data},
you can find out what is needed via \code{colnames(model.matrix(formula, data))}.
(However, for an ordinal model, we expect the first \code{ordinal.dim - 1} coefficients
to replace \code{(Intercept)}. And for a multivariate model, we expect \code{coef} 
to be a matrix with these row names, and \code{vcov} to have as many rows and columns as
the total number of elements of \code{coef}.)

If \code{object} is specified, this function serves as a generic for dispatching
a method for \code{object}'s class. See the arguments for \code{qdrg.default} to
see how the arguments are determined by default. For many \code{lm}- or \code{glm}-like
models, it may suffice override just one or two of these
defaults. The possibility of a custom \code{qdrg} method also provides a
minimal way for package developers to provide \pkg{emmeans} support: it doesn't
allow directly applying \code{emmeans()} on the model, but at least the user
can obtain a reference grid, and then go from there. Note that when using a `qdrg` 
method, it is best for the user to specify `object =` explicitly in the
call, since `object` is not the first argument of `qdrg()`. However, if the
first argument is not a formula, the function is retried with it as \code{object}.

The functions \code{\link{qdrg}} and \code{emmobj} are close cousins, in that
they both produce \code{emmGrid} objects. When starting with summary
statistics for an existing grid, \code{emmobj} is more useful, while
\code{qdrg} is more useful when starting from a fitted model.
}
\note{
For backwards compatibility, an argument \code{ordinal.dim} is invisibly 
supported as part of \code{...}, and if present, sets 
\code{ordinal = list(dim = ordinal.dim, mode = "latent")}
}
\section{Rank deficiencies}{

Different model-fitting packages take different approaches when the model
matrix is singular, but \code{qdrg} tries to reconcile them by comparing the
linear functions created by \code{formula} to \code{coefs} and \code{vcov}.
We may then use the \pkg{estimability} package to determine what quantities
are estimable. For reconciling to work properly, \code{coef} should be named
and \code{vcov} should have dimnames. To disable this name-matching
action, remove the names from \code{coef}, e.g., by calling \code{unname()}.
No reconciliation is attempted in multivariate-response cases. For more
details on estimability, see the documentation in the \pkg{estimability}
package.
