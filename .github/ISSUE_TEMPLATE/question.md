## Explain your question
Tell me your concern, and illustrate it using enough code and output that I 
can reproduce it, and enough output (including annotations and messages) 
that I can tell what went wrong. Try to keep the example small and the
variable names simple.


## Ground rules
  * I really do expect you to look at the documentation and vignettes before
    sending questions.
  * Did you know that there is an index of vignette topics? That can be
    helpful for finding help on certain topics. See
    https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/vignettes/vignette-topics.html
  * More than one or two pipes is usually too many. I'd rather see the individual 
    steps and the results thereof.
  * Please examine the output from what you have tried. Often there are a few
    lines of annotation below the output. If you wrap your results with 
    `as.data.frame()` once or twice to suppress those annotations, I
    consider that willful ignorance, and will not help you.
  * Please do not create different objects having the same name; 
    that causes confusion and makes it hard to refer to particular results.
