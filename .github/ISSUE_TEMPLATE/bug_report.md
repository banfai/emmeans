## Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## To reproduce
Show me code and output that reproduces the bug. 
Please use a small data set (built-in if possible) and simple variable names.
And please, do not create different objects having the same name; 
to compare two or three different models or methods, give those objects
different names so we can talk about them.

## Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

## Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.

## Ground rules
  * I really do expect you to look at the documentation and vignettes before
    sending bug reports. Make sure that you have used things as they are documented.
  * More than one or two pipes is usually too many. I'd rather see the individual 
    steps and the results thereof.
  * Did you know that there is an index of vignette topics? That can be
    helpful for clarifying certain issues. See
    https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/vignettes/vignette-topics.html
  * Please examine the output from what you have tried. Often there are a few
    lines of annotation below the output. If you wrap your results with 
    `as.data.frame()` once or twice to suppress those annotations, I
    consider that willful ignorance, and will not help you.
