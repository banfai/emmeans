**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To reproduce**
Show me code and output that reproduces the bug. 
But please:

  1. Do not use `as.data.frame` anywhere. That suppresses annotations that you need to see
  2. Do not create different objects having the same name. That just causes confusion.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
